This is project day 2 and I tackled if/else,loops and functions in python language.
The following are the lists of programs made:

. A program that assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed
. A program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line
. A program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal
. A prints numbers from 0 to 99.
. A program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
. Write a function that checks for lowercase character
. Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
. Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
. Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
. Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.
. Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space
